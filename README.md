My Career Guide – Digital Career & Domain Counselling Platform

This project is something I built to help students like me figure out the right career path and technical domain based on their interests, skills, and goals. It’s a web-based platform that gives personalized guidance through quizzes, detailed roadmaps, and course recommendations.

I wanted to make career counselling more accessible and smart — so I built this using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrated features like authentication, quiz history tracking, and feedback submission.

Features:-

Career Quiz – Suggests the most suitable career path based on user choices.

Domain Quiz – Helps students, especially in IT, find their ideal specialization.

Personalized Roadmap – Step-by-step plan for skill development and learning.

Course Recommendations – Curated learning resources to match your career goals.

User Login & Register – Secure authentication using JWT.

Quiz History – Keeps track of past quiz attempts and suggestions.

Feedback Section – Lets users share their thoughts and suggestions easily.
